Trade-offs / Notes

Task filtering and sorting are performed client-side.

Modal date inputs require ISO string conversion.

Socket.IO provides notifications; currently, only admin email is used for events.

No component library used (e.g., Vuetify) to reduce bundle size.

TailwindCSS ensures responsive layout.
